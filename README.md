Hello, and welcome.

In this repository, I will be documenting my Python learning journey. I shall have a Jupyter notebook and also projects I have had to have embarked on and possibly the list of resources I have used, some of which are;

- Learn Python the Hard Way (5ed) by Zed A. Shaw.
- Learn Enough Python to be Dangerous by Michael Hartl.

  
That being said, enjoy!
